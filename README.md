# Time Series

The data for this project has been extracted from the dataset Absenteeism at Work in
the UCL Machine Learning Repository, which was created from records of absenteeism
at work at a courier company in Brazil.
This dataset contains the absenteeism time (in hours), together with information on
transportation expense, distance from residence to work, service time and some personal
details. Data are provided for about three years, from July 2007 to July 2010. The
description of the variables is available in Table 1.
